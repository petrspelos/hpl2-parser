//Episode 7//
//All of this is for the maps .hps file///
//Start by creating in your map a key and a door to open and then name them//
//This first line goes in your main functions ex.(OnStart, OnEnter, OnLeave)//

//Remember this can be either OnStart, OnEnter, OnLeave//
void OnStart() 
{
	AddUseItemCallback("", "*KeyName*", "*DoorName*", "*FunctionName*", true);
} 
//It doesn't even have to be in those main functions but that is the best way to utilize it//

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//When using the following//
AddUseItemCallback("", "*KeyName*", "*DoorName*", "*FunctionName*", true);
//You declared a new function named...//
*FunctionName*
//Which means when the ItemCallback is triggered it will run a new function//
//This new function will be called...//
*FunctionName*

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

//To run this new function you must declare it//
void *FuntionName*(string &in asItem, string &in asEntity)
{

}
//This looks similar to the OnStart, OnEnter, OnLeave functions except this line...//
(string &in asItem, string &in asEntity)
//That addition defines it as a function that can be ran when the function is called//

string &in asItem, string &in asEntity //asItem and asEntity show that its triggered by Items and Entities//

//Now to wrap it up we will need commands to go inside of this function to make the key open a certain door//

//Below the function is going to change something about a swing door (the kind of doors that can be opened)//
SetSwingDoorLocked("*DoorName*", false, true);				
//*DoorName* will be the name of the door you want to open//
//false states weather the door will be locked or unlocked in this case locked is false (meaning the door will unlock)//
//true states weather the playings lantern will go off upon opening this door with the key//

//Now we will use a function that will play a sound upon the door being unlocked//

PlaySoundAtEntity("*NameWhatever*", "unlock_door", "Player", 0, false);	
//*NameWhatever* can be called anything but I perfer to leave it blank like this PlaySoundAtEntity("", etc.//
//unlock_door is the name of the sound effect that will be played upon running this function//
//Player is so that the sound will be played to the player//
//0 stands for the time it will take to fade away the sound effect, in this case the sound will just stop instead of fading//
//false means that the repeat is false, so if this were true the sound would continue to loop//

//Finally this function will remove the key from the players inventory//
RemoveItem("*KeyName*"); 
//*KeyName* being the name of the key//

//Now lets put it all together to see how it will actually look in the .hps file//
void OnStart() 
{
	AddUseItemCallback("", "*KeyName*", "*DoorName*", "*FunctionName*", true);
} 

void *FuntionName*(string &in asItem, string &in asEntity)
{
    SetSwingDoorLocked("*DoorName*", false, true);
	PlaySoundAtEntity("", "unlock_door", "Player", 0, false);
	RemoveItem("*KeyName*"); 
}
//Now let's see it with the actual information filled out, I'm going to make up some names//
void OnStart() 
{
	AddUseItemCallback("", "storageroomkey", "storageroomdoor", "openstorageroom", true);
} 

void openstorageroom(string &in asItem, string &in asEntity)
{
    SetSwingDoorLocked("storageroomdoor", false, true);
	PlaySoundAtEntity("", "unlock_door", "Player", 0, false);
	RemoveItem("storageroomkey"); 
}
//So in this case the key is named in the map as storageroomkey//
//The door to be unlocked is named storageroomdoor//
//openstorageroom is the name of the function//
//It is named openstorageroom just to help with identifying what door will be opened but...//
//It can easily be renamed to something random like pickle...//
//But openstorageroom helps when you need to look back at all your code//

//Lastly to input the key name and description use the following//
//In the .lang file//
  <CATEGORY Name="Inventory">
    <Entry Name="ItemName_*KeySubName*">*YourKeyName*</Entry>
    <Entry Name="ItemDesc_*KeySubName*">*KeyDescription*</Entry>
     </CATEGORY>
